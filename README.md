# SPH_Arterial_Delamination_HA
The SPH code for "particle-based computational modelling of arterial disease", published in Royal Society Interface. 

This is the "Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics" simulation code for the following published paper:
"Particle-based computational modelling of arterial disease", (2018). H. Ahmadzadeh, M. Rausch, J. Humphrey, Royal Society Interface.

The code is highly parallelized with mpirun and the input text files, containing the coordinates of the particles and the input geometrical parameters are also included.
